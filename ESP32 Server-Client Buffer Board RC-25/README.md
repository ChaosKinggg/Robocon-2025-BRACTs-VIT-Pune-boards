# ESP32 Server–Client Buffer Board RC-25  
**System Integration & Rapid Deployment Interface Board**

This buffer board was designed to enable **distributed system deployment and integration** using **two ESP32 DevKit V1 boards**, configured in a **Server–Client architecture**.  
The intent of the board is to separate **wireless control logic** from **real-time sensor acquisition**, while providing clean, robust interfaces to external controllers such as **STM32F407 DISC1** and **Arduino Mega**.

The Server ESP32 handles all wireless operations, while the Client ESP32 is dedicated to sensor data acquisition and wired communication.

## Design Objectives
- Enable clear separation of wireless control and sensor acquisition
- Reduce system latency by offloading time-critical tasks to a dedicated client
- Provide structured, application-oriented breakouts for sensors and communication
- Enable reliable wired communication to external controllers
- Improve power safety, robustness, and system-level control

## System Architecture Overview
- **Server ESP32**
  - Handles wireless communication
  - Receives commands from control applications
  - Updates system state and parameters
- **Client ESP32**
  - Dedicated to sensor data acquisition
  - Interfaces with encoders and IMU
  - Forwards acquired data to STM32 / Arduino Mega via UART or RS-485

---

## Controller Communication Interfaces
- Wired communication from **Client ESP32** to external controllers
- Designed to interface with:
  - STM32 microcontrollers
  - Arduino Mega
- Communication supported via UART or RS-485 for noise-immunity

---

## Encoder Interfaces (Client ESP32)
- **4 dedicated terminal blocks** for optical rotary encoders
- On-board **pull-up resistors** provided for encoder signals

## Communication Interfaces

### UART
- **Both Server and Client ESP32 UARTs broken out**
- Each UART having **two alternative terminal blocks**:
  - Standard UART (TX/RX)
  - RS-485 interface

### RS-485 Support
- On-board RS-485 transceivers enabling UART-to-RS485 communication
- Direction control configurable using **0-ohm jumpers** for:
  - Transmit
  - Receive
- Enables robust long-distance, noise-immune communication with external controllers

- Supports remote control operations including:
  - Resetting **Client ESP32**
  - Resetting connected **STM32**
  - Resetting connected **Arduino Mega**
- Enables centralized system control without physical access

---

## Power Architecture & Protection
