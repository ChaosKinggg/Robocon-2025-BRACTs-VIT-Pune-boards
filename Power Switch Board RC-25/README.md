# Power Switch Board RC-25  
**System Integration & High-Power Distribution Interface Board**

This board was designed as a **relay-based main power distribution board** for robotics operating at **24 V**.
It is intended to safely distribute **high-power supply voltage** to downstream Power electronics systems.

This board can be used **in parallel with the Logic Switch Board**, where a buck converter steps down **24 V → 12 V** to power logic electronics.

## Design Objectives
- Safely distribute high-power supply voltage across multiple subsystems
- Provide a clear and reliable manual power control mechanism
- Enable emergency shutdown via an external kill switch
- Allow clean separation of power and logic domains

---

## Power Distribution Interfaces
- **6 XT60 connectors** for power output distribution
- Designed to operate at **24 V**
- Suitable for higher current delivery compared to logic-level distribution
- Enables centralized power routing to motor drivers and Buck converters

---

## Switching Architecture
- **Relay-based power switching**
- Relay used to isolate and control the main power rail
- Designed to handle higher voltage and current levels
- Switching is **manual only** and requires user interaction

---

## Control & Actuation Interfaces

### Power Enable Options
Two independent methods provided to turn ON the main power rail:

- **Push-lock switch**
  - Direct on-board manual control
  - Requires intentional press to change power state
- **External kill switch (Relimate connector)**
  - Designed to connect to an externally mounted, easily accessible kill switch
  - Intended for emergency shutdown in out-of-control situations

### Selection Mechanism
- Power enable source selected using **shorting selection flags**
- Allows choosing between:
  - On-board push-lock switch
  - External kill switch input

---

## Protection & Safety Features
- **Flyback diode across relay coil**
  - Protects control circuitry from inductive voltage spikes
  - Improves relay reliability and operational lifetime
- **Via-stitched high-current power tracks**
  - Power traces are reinforced using via stitching
  - Improves current-carrying capability across PCB layers
  - Reduces resistive losses and localized heating
  - Enhances thermal distribution and overall board reliability

## Power Status Indication
- **Battery presence LED**
  - Indicates that the 24 V supply is connected
- **Main power ON LED**
  - Indicates that the switched power rail is active
- Clear distinction between supply availability and enabled output
