# Robocon 2025 BRACTs VIT-Pune Hardware Boards Repository

Welcome to the **Robocon 2025 BRACTs VIT-Pune Hardware Boards Repository**.  
This repository contains the collection of **competition-used hardware and buffer boards** developed for **Robocon 2025** by me along with my teammates, under the guidance of our seniors.

All boards were **designed using Altium Designer**, **manufactured in-house for testing and validation**, and after successful revision and validation, **fabricated using professional PCB fabrication services**. Final boards were **assembled in-house** and used by **BRACT’s VIT Pune** during **Robocon 2025**.

## 🤖 What is Robocon?
**ABU Robocon (Asia-Pacific Robot Contest)** is an international robotics competition where student teams design and build robots to solve a themed challenge under strict constraints.

Key aspects of Robocon:
- Entire robot is **student-built**
- Strong focus on **electronics, embedded systems, and mechanical integration**
- Emphasis on **reliability, speed, and real-time performance**
- Engineering under **tight time and resource constraints**

## 📦 Boards & Repository Overview
This repository includes multiple boards developed for different subsystems of the robot, such as:

- [**Arduino-Mega Buffer Board RC-25**](./Arduino-Mega%20Buffer%20Board%20RC-25): Interface and buffering board for Arduino Mega based control systems.
- [**ESP32 Server-Client Buffer Board RC-25**](./ESP32%20Server-Client%20Buffer%20Board%20RC-25): Communication buffer board for reliable ESP32-based server–client interaction.
- [**Logic Switch Board RC-25**](./Logic%20Switch%20Board%20RC-25): Low-Power distribution and controlled switching board for robot subsystems.
- [**Pneumatics Solenoid Driver RC-25**](./Pneumatics%20Solenoid%20Driver%20RC-25): driver board for controlling pneumatic solenoid valves.
- [**Power Switch Board RC-25**](./Power%20Switch%20Board%20RC-25): High-Power distribution and controlled switching board for robot subsystems.
- [**STM32F407-DISC Buffer Board RC-25**](./STM32F407-DISC%20Buffer%20Board%20RC-25): Interface and buffering board for STM32F407 Discovery based control systems.

The boards were iteratively developed through:
1. **Design and in-house prototype manufacturing for testing and validation**
2. **Design revisions based on observations**
3. **In-house assembly and competition deployment**

Each board resides in its respective folder with **relevant design files and documentation**.

## 📐 Project Details
Each board folder typically contains:

- **Schematic Files** – Complete circuit designs  
- **PCB Layout Files** – Routing, stack-up, and placement details  
- **3D PCB Views** – Mechanical and assembly visualization  
- **Deployed Build** – Images of actual boards used at Robocon 2025  

These designs prioritize **functional reliability and competition performance** over cosmetic or commercial-grade finish.
